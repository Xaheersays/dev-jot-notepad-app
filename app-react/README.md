## Current React Version State

This version of the app is built using React. This is a work in progress â€“ please see the current [live version](https://dev-jot-react.netlify.app/)
## Project Set-Up

The easiest and quickest way to get the project up and running locally is to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrobind/dev-jot.git
```

Make sure you're in the `app-react` directory

```bash
cd app-react
```

Now install packages with NPM

```bash
npm i
```

For the React version of the site, you don't need to use the VS Code Live Server extension. Because this version uses Create React App, it comes with a hot reloading development server. 

To run the app:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a development server with hot reloading at `http://localhost:3000/`
